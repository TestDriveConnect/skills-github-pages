The Problem
Car buyers hesitate to purchase vehicles from out-of-state dealerships because they can’t see, touch, or test drive the car before committing. Transfer fees, no-return policies, and the risk of disappointment prevent many deals from closing—costing dealerships sales and customers peace of mind.

The Solution
TestDrive Connect bridges this gap by connecting buyers with local test drivers—trusted individuals who will inspect, test drive, and report back on a vehicle before the buyer pays a dime in transfer fees. Think of it like Uber for test drives: a community-driven service providing honest insights to customers, and helping dealerships sell more cars, faster.
